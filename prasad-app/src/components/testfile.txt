Hello Everyone. I'm new to react(from ASP.NET background)
This is my Parent Component's method -
``` greetParent=(childName)=>{
        alert(`Hello ${this.state.parentName} from ${childName} `);
    } ```

This is my Child Component -
 ``` <div>
        <button onClick={()=>props.greetHandler('child')} className='btn btn-info m-2'>GREET PARENT</button>
    </div> ```

Now when i'm usng an arrow function in my Parent, it is works to show an alert box. When I use a normal function, it doesn't. I want to know the reason behind this.
